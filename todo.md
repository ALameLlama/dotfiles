- move language specific stuff from home/programes/shell to separate modules
  - Add toggleable config options for this instead of imports
- move to hyper land? create a module to make swapping between de and wm easier
- I need to clean up hosts/framework16 file, it's a bit messy atm
- 1password sshkeys
  - I have this working but it's not like how they do it in the docs, I think I've hacked mine togehter to get the home-manager side to work
  - git signing again, I think this works but idk
